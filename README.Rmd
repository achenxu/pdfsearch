# pdfsearch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lebebr01/pdfsearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lebebr01/pdfsearch)

This package defines a few useful functions for keyword searching using the [pdftools](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools)  package developed by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).

To install use devtools:
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('lebebr01/pdfsearch')
```

## Basic Usage
There are currently two functions in this package. The first `keyword_search` takes a single pdf and searches for keywords from the pdf. The second `directory_search` does the same search over a directory of pdfs.

Examples to come.
